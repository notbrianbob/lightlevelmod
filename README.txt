Minecraft 1.20.4 Light Overlay mod

THIS MOD IS IN EXTREMELY EARLY ACCESS AND WILL NOT WORK CURRENTLY
I will update this readme when the mod is functioning

This mod allows you to see a light overlay to see where mobs can spawn and place torches more efficiently.

Controls: F7

TODO:
-[ ] Base mod functionality
-[ ] Any additional functionality
